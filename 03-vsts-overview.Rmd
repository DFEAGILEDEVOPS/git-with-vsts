# Visual Studio Team Services

## Background

So far we have only looked at git in the context of local projects and command line software. This alone doesn't make collaborating on code easy. 

What is needed is a central platform where people can request for changes to be made to the code base and update their code based on changes by others.  

This concept in git is known as [remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes). The following are examples of interactive services that allow you to manage git projects effectively:

- [GitHub](github.com)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
- [GitLab](gitlab.com/)
- [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/).

We are using **Visual Studio Team Services** as this is the Department's tool of choice for internal version control. We would use platorms such as GitHub for our more publically facing projects (such as this book).

## Theory 

At a high level when you are using VSTS (or any type of remote) you are creating a central copy of your code on a server (the VSTS site). 

The aim of any project is to get your final complete code on to the master branch of the server copy. Analysts will still make and run all their changes locally but will then use the concepts of *pushing*, *pulling* and *pull requesting* to get the VSTS version up to date.

Having this central repository and the approval processes that VSTS provides means that multiple analysts can work on a project at the same time and systematically merge all their changes into the final version after code review.

The following diagram illustrates the concept of server and local copies.

## Generating Git Credentials

Before we get started we can create some credentials that we will be asked for later on to log your local git into VSTS.

To do this you need do the following:

1. Click on your user icon on the top right
2. Hit Security
3. Hit Personal Access Tokens 
4. Create Credentials

The following clip outlines the process:

## Setting up a Repository

To set up a repository on VSTS you simply hit new project on the hompage and fill in the project details. 

This will create you an empty git repo on VSTS.

The following clip outlines the process:

**Note:** Not all users will have permissions to create projects on VSTS. They will instead ask for them to be created by their VSTS admin.

## Adding an Existing Project

When you first create a VSTS project it will create a blank repo. You then have mutiple options on what to do from there. 

The Two main options are 

1. Clone to your computer (cloning will be exlpained in *Cloning a repository*)
2. Push an Existing repository (Will go into detail later)

Most likely you will have started your work locally so will be opting for the 2nd option. 

In order to Push an existing repository you need to do the following:

1. Select the *or push an existing repository from the command line option*
2. Git Bash in your local git repo
3. Copy the code and run it

This will set up the connection to VSTS and push an entire copy of the repo up to VSTS.

The following clip outlines this process:

**Note:** The first time you do this you will be asked for VSTS credentials created previously.

## Adding users to a project

VSTS is a locked down code environment where users need to first be given permission to access the site as a whole and then individual projects. 

To add users to a project you simply do the following on a project home page:

1. Click + button under members
2. Search for user
3. Hit Add

The user will then get a welcome email inviting them to the project.

The following clip outlines this process:

## Clone

If you have joined an existing project where code already exists on VSTS you will need to clone the repository to get a local copy. 

What this will do is create a local copy and establish the connections for pushing and pulling for you.
