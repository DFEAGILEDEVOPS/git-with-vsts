# VSTS - Workflow

## Starting VSTS project

- Make project in VSTS

- Pull to a local repository OR push local changes (make sure you've committed your
  changes!)

## Making Changes

- Work may be assigned to you as a "Work Item" use the link to make new branch

- Locally, pull to your master branch
`sh git pull`

- `sh git checkout <your_branch_name>` Will create a new branch locally with the 
same name as the one you made on VSTS. It will also "track" the one on VSTS, meaning 
all your pushes and pulls are set up. 

- Make your changes

- Commit your changes. You can make as many commits as you need to. As ever, make 
them roughly self-contained chunks that would be easy for someone to review piece by piece
`sh git add <file_list>`
`sh git commit -m "Commit message"`

## Merging
- When you've made enough changes to complete your work item checkout the master 
branch in your local repository. do a pull in case anyone else had made changes
`sh git checkout master`
`sh git pull`

- Switch back to your working branch. Merge any changes from master.
`sh git checkout <your_branch_name>`
`sh git merge master`

- Sort out any merge conflicts.
`sh git status` will list the files that have merge conflicts. Open the files with 
the conflicts, and search them for "<<<<". Everything from the next line up until 
a line of "=====" will be from the master branch. Everything from the "====" line 
until ">>>>" will be from your working branch. Work through the code to make sure 
that you keep all the necessary changes. It might require a bit of work as you might 
want to keep your changes and the changes to master. Don't just idly delete things!
Add and commit the changes.
`sh git add <files to be merged>`
`sh git commit -m "Commit message (it's advised to mention the merge)"`

## Share you changes VSTS

- Push your changes to VSTS
`sh git push`

- On VSTS make a pull request for your branch

- Have someone review your work
