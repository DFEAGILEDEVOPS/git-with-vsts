# Recommended Workflow

## Local Branch

Once you have cloned the repo you need to decide your way of working. 

The two different ways of working you could follow are as follows:

1. Working directly on master
2. Branching for distrinct pieces of work and merging back into master when complete
 
Although working on master can be acceptable for projects in which you are working alone, this book advocates the 2nd methedology. 

In conjunction with VSTS this methedology allows you to make use of pull requests were changes from one branch are reviewed and merged into anoter. 

Utilising work items outlined in the previous chapter you should create a branch for each work item, complete the work in that branch and pull request it back into master. 

At a high level you can use the following convention for naming your branches:

1. **feature/short_name**: This is for items of work that you have defined as individual features.

2. **bug/short_name**: This is for applying fixes to your code.

As per the local git chapter you can create a branch as follows:

```sh
git branch feature/short_name
```

and then check the branch out as follows:

```sh
git checkout feature/short_name
```

## Push 

After making the required changes for a work item in a branch and committing them locally you can then *Push* the changes up to VSTS. 

The following will push your code to the remote:

```sh
git push
```

If the branch is new git will provide you with the code to create a new branch on VSTS and then push. You can copy it and hit enter. 

If it is an existing branch the above code will sufice.
